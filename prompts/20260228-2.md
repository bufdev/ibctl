A few things:

- You should use no global state. If a parameter is required, make it part of the constructor. For example, you use slog.Default(). Use the logger from the appext.Container and pass it down as a required param. Look at buf for examples. You're over-relying on functional options. Functional options are only for actual optional things.
- The cli package was just me being lazy. Abstract it out into helper packages as appopriate.
- Name the pkg/ IBKR packages with ibkr prefix.
- Same for fxrate if it uses a specific provider.
- Add more details to the README.md about the stored data format (what protobuf messages represent each?)
- Perhaps move all data messages to ibctl.data package? so proto/ibctl/data/*
- The README.md should provide instructions on the configuration file
- **Make sure the EXACT instructions of what I need to do on IBKR are stored**.
- Propose and use an env var for any needed API keys.
